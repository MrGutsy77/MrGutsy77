## 🛠️ Solidity Developer | Cybersecurity Specialist  

I write smart contracts the way they should be written — secure, efficient, and built to last.  
Certified in cybersecurity (Security+), with a focus on writing Solidity contracts that don't just work but *hold their ground* when things get messy.  

### 🔐 What I Bring to the Table:
- Solidity development with a focus on **security-first architecture**.  
- Gas optimization without sacrificing reliability.  
- A growing arsenal of personal coding strategies — because best practices are a good start, but never the finish line.  

### 🎯 Philosophy:
Code should be paranoid. Assume the worst, plan for worse than that. I write contracts with the mindset that someone's already trying to break them.
